# AHM-YOLO Chestnut Maturity Sample Dataset

This repository provides a representative **sample subset** of the dataset used in the paper:

**"Chestnut Maturity Detection and Segmentation in Orchard Environments Using an Improved YOLO-Based Method".**

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the **data structure**, **annotation format**, and **typical image conditions** used in the study, in accordance with transparency requirements of peer-reviewed publications.

Only **a small portion** of the original dataset is released here.  
The complete dataset cannot be published due to orchard confidentiality agreements, ongoing research plans, and deployment considerations for orchard automation.
